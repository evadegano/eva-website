1. set up your website with nextJS

2. use mdx to write blog posts

mdx gives you a lot more flexibility than plain Markdown. Like embed videos for instance, or any other customized JSX components.
At the same time, you won't have to waste time with html tags.

How awesome is that?

3. make a dynamic table of contents
add id to titles https://tomekdev.com/posts/anchors-for-headings-in-mdx
