In this post, I assume that you have some knowledge of the programming jargon.

Programming paradigms are not languages, but ways of using those languages. Like a writing style. The influence how your code is organized.

Paradigms help classify languages based on their features, though a certain language can be used for different paradigms.

## 1. Functional programming
- super popular
- functional programming focuses on, well functions
- So basically, ou organize things into functions
- functions = they input data and output data
- pure functional = functions don't store state and don't mutate the incoming data (their paramaters)

Strengths:
- as states are not modified (no writing operation), you don't have to worry about concurrency and threading because we're not sharing memory
- in pure functional programming, functions tend to be short
- code tends to be clean, which reduces bugs and makes it easy to test

## 2. Object-oriented programming
- in OO programming, things are organized into objects (classes)
- object = a way of encapsulating state and behavior
- state = variables
- behavior = what you do with states (methods)

Strengths:
- great at modeling real life objects and their attributes (ex: a car, its color, engine, brand, etc)
- they are reusable
- they are easy to test

## 3. Modular programming
- separate each functionality into an independent file (module)

strengths:
- very organized
- easy to navigate
- easy to test, maintain and debugg

## 4. Concurrent programming
- maximizes the use of a computer's finite ressources by overlapping some program computations (instead of running them one after the other)
- uses a computer architecture concept called multi-threading

## 3. Procedural
- based on formal logic: and, or implications
- not made up of instructions but of facts and clauses
-
