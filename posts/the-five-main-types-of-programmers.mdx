The world of programming is surprisingly large.

While Computer Science is closely related to mathematics, not all programmers are that CS-oriented or even like maths at all.

Not sure how you want to position yourself in that ecosystem?

In this post, I show you the 5 main types of Programmers so that you can decides which suits you most. 

Of course, keep in mind that there's an infinite amount of nuances and ultimately, you'll probably develop your own hybrid style.

## 1. Software Engineer

Even though the words Software Engineer and Web Developer are often used to talk about the same thing, they do differ in some ways.

While web developers mainly work with websites, web apps, and APIs, Software Engineers design, implement and maintain programs running on hardware, operating systems, and networks. So basically, the apps you install on your computer.

Main skills they need:
- Proficient in at least one programming language (Python, C++, Scala, Java, Go, NodeJs, etc)
- Strong background in Computer Science (algorithms, data structures, etc)
- Good knowledge of frameworks, software architecture, design patterns, interconnectivity, etc

## 2. Front-end Web Developer

They build the part of a product that is visible to users.

Main skills they need:
- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React or Vue
- JavaScript libraries like <a src='https://greensock.com/' target='_blank'>Greensock</a> and <a src='https://threejs.org/' blank='_target'>Three.js</a> to do animation and 3D
- Some basics of UX/UI and an interest for web design
- An understanding of event-based interaction, security, and performance

See a detailed roadmap <a src='https://roadmap.sh/frontend' target='_blank'>here</a>.

This is generally considered to be the more creative side of programming.

## 3. Back-end Web Developer

They work on implementing the logic behind what users see.

Main skills they need:
- Proficient in at least one programming language (Python, C#, Rust, Java, Go, NodeJs, etc)
- Servers and databases (SQL or no SQL)
- API layer
- Good knowledge of frameworks, software architecture, design patterns, interconnectivity, etc

See a detailed roadmap <a src='https://roadmap.sh/backend' target='_blank'>here</a>.

This is considered to be the more logical side of programming and where there may be more Computer Science at play.

## 4. Full-stack Web Developer

Can't decide between front-end and back-end ? Then being a Full-Stack Developer may just be your calling.

As a Full-Stack Dev, you'd have to know how to work on both sides of a product and engineer a full solution.

## 5. DevOps Engineer

They bridge the gap between software development and IT operations to facilitate code releases and deployments.

Main skills they need:
- Proficient in at least one programming language (Python, C#, Rust, Java, Go, NodeJs, etc)
- Automation tools like Jenkins and Bamboo
- Containerization software such as Docker and Kubernetes
- Configuration management and automation (e.g Puppet Enterprise, Ansible, Chef)
- Infrastructure Orchestration
- Monitoring and analytics
- Testing and Cloud Quality tools
- Network protocols
