computers ony understand zeroes and ones

1. Low-level languages

machine language:
- developed and used to controle the CPU
- strictly numerical

assembly language
- used mnemonic code to translate machine code into a more human readable form
- assembly code is turned into machine code by an assembler, so that it can be executed by the computer

2. High-Level languages

- More modern
- Readable
- They automate some tasks (like memory management) to make the programming process easier
- Most of them are converted into machine code by assemblers and compilers. Some of them are interpreted and don't need to be compiled.
