Being a web developer or a software engineer is not just about knowing a programming language.

There are lots of other concepts you need to get familiar with. And depending on what your goals and the kind of Programmer you want to be, your journey will vary greatly!

You can use cool tools like <a src='https://roadmap.sh/' target='_blank'>Roadmap.sh</a> to guide your learning path. Or even take Open Source Society University's <a src='https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum' target='_blank'>full program in Computer Science</a>.
But let's be honest, if your goal is to find a job in tech in 6 months or less, I doubt you'll have time to dive into all the concepts they outline.

What I give you below is the system I followed to maximize my learning in the shortest time possible, graduate top of my bootcamp's cohort, and feel ready to be hired as a junior full-stack web developer. It goes without saying that my learning path is by no means the only nor the best one out there, but it can definitely serve as a basis to start from.

## 1. Learn some technological basics

From what I've seen around me, many people skip this step.

But come on! How can you feel comfortable as a Web Developer if you don't know how the internet actually works? How can you be a Software Engineer if you don't understand how computers work?

If you don't have a basic understanding of what stuff like a CPU, the binary number system, an IP address or a server are, I strongly recommend you start with <a src='https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology' target='_blank'>CS50’s Understanding Technology</a> from Harvard. It's free and like all Harvard courses, it simply is phenomenal.

## 2. Take an intro course in Computer Science

Computer science is "the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence." (<a src='https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science' target='_blank'>Britannica</a>)

Even though you can learn Programming without studying Computer Science (like they do in many Web Dev bootcamps), having some basics will give you a deeper understanding of how coding works and help you learn a lot more quickly.

Once again, Harvard has blessed us with a free course that not only will teach you all you need to get started, but will also spark a passion for CS in you.

You'll see. <a src='https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?index=product&queryID=67cd34901aad219b4f5762b662a7a5ee&position=1' target='_blank'>CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a> is for sure one of the most exciting, interesting and easy to understand courses you'll take in your whole life.

Just one thing though, take your time and do the exercises. Otherwise, there's no point in taking this course.

## 3. Learn a programming language

If you've followed Harvard's aforementioned course, you now have some basic knowledge of C++ and Python. Well, now is the fun part where you're going to take that further and learn the sh*t out of them.

Though the language you choose depends on your goal, I would recommend to start with an easy language. If you plan on being a Front-End Web Developer, starting with a HTML and CSS before you dive in Javascript makes sense.

If you plan on being more Back-End, I'd say that Python is amazing to start. Because it has a very minimal syntax, you can focus your energy on understanding programming logic without worrying about where to put parenthesis and semi-colons.

Here are two amazing free ressources that will help you get going:
- <a src='https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript' target='_blank'>Harvard's Programming Course</a>
- <a src='https://www.freecodecamp.org/' target='_blank'>FreeCodeCamp</a>

And here are some tips to speed up your learning process:
- Don’t freak out. Whenever the voice in your head tells you “damn that’s so hard”, remember that in just a few days, you'll be smiling at how easy this actually is for you now.
- Approach it in the most structured way possible. Coding is similar to writing a dissertation (only a lot more fun). Instead of writing a bunch of spaghetti code and hope for the best, the easiest way to go about it is to write down a structure and/or steps in comments or pseudo code, and then fill it in with actual code.
- Don't try to memorize every built-in function right away: that's what practice will help you with.

If you plan on being a Full-Stack or Front-End Web Dev, you must also learn a framework (React, Angular, Vue.js, Next.js, etc). You may want to look at job offers and see which frameworks are the most in-demand.

Finally, here are some other core concepts you need to study:
- Programming paradigms
- Testing in your language and framework of choice
- Databases: SQL (relational databases) and noSQL or (non-relational databases)
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): REST API and GraphQL
- User authentication, authorization and sessions
- How to deploy an app

## 4. Study the basics of algorithms and data structures

This is something they don't necessarily teach in coding bootcamps, but that will make you a way stronger Programmer. This will especially improve your problem-solving skills and make you aware of how your coding choices impact performance.
