Technical interviews are hands down the most stressful thing for a junior Web Developer.

But with the right strategy, not only will you feel ready to take up on that challenge, you'll also feel excited as hell to put your new algo-solving skills to the test!

Train for technical interviews and find a way to fall in love with problem solving. Fight your brain’s initial instinct to freeze and panic. Tell yourself that the problem is easier that it seems (which it is). And look at it methodically. Try to approach it in a way that’s fun for you, or to associate it with something you like (riddles, ...)


## 1. Learn about Big O Notation and common complexities

## 2. Practice your recursive thinking
Recursions are when a function or some other subprogram calls itself.
"Wtf" is what you usually say to yourself the first time you see a recursion.

But do not panic!
With a bit of practice - about 10 hours of it - recursions will start making sense.

And you'll see how f*cking cool they are. Recursion is definitely this thing that makes you answer problems elegantly and feel proud about your problem-solving skills.

## 3. Study the most common data structures and algorithms

While data structure are ways to store and organize data, algorithms process that data and perform calculations to find a solution to a problem.

## 6. Practice on problems
Alright, now the real fun begins!

Resolving algorithmic problems may seem super annoying at first, but after a few exercices, you'll see that this is by far the most rewarding step.

At a certain point, your brain will start to 'get it' and everything will start being obvious.

With all the coding practice sites out there, which one should you choose?

In my experience, avoid Codewars! There are way too many problems and most of them are low quality.
Instead, go for a platform that has a more curated content.

If you're willing to pay, I strongly recommend you use [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product).
As it was designed for the sole purpose of hepling you ace your technical interview, it will save you a lot of time and energy.
