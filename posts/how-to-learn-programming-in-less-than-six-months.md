Depending on what your goals are, your journey to becoming a programmer will vary greatly!
What I give you below is the system I followed to maximize my learning in the shortest time possible.
But depending on your goals and constraintes, you may want to skip some of those steps or dig deeper.

1. Get a [hardware refresher](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology).
This is not mandatory and from what I've seen around me, most people skip this step.
However, it gives you a basic understanding of the very material you have and you will use as a developer.

2. Study the basics of Computer Science.
I strongly recommend you take [Harvard's CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?index=product&queryID=67cd34901aad219b4f5762b662a7a5ee&position=1). Not only is it free, but it's hands down one of the most exciting, interesting to follow and easy to understand courses I've taken in my life.

Though learning Computer Science is not a essential to learn programming (after all, most bootcamps in Paris don't teach CS), it will give you a deep understanding and a strong foundation on which to learn web development. 

Just one thing: take your time and do the exercises. This will jump start your programming thinking.

3. Learn programming.
Eather learn by yourself or do a bootcamp.

There are amazing free ressources out there:
- Harvard's [Programming Course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum), which is quite intense but you can pick whatever material you're interested in

Anyway, here are some tips I can give you:
- Start with an easy language.
  - Ultimately, the languages you want to learn will depend on the kind of developer you wan't to be
  - However, starting with an easy language can be a change changer. While Python is super easy, C++ can be quite challenging for most people.
- Don’t freak out
- 10x principle: for any new skill that you are going to learn, train your mind first
- The first thing you must learn is that there is no such thing as “hard”
- Once you understand something and practice a bit, you always realize that this was easy all along
- So whenever the voice in your head tells you “damn that’s hard”, say to yourself “in just a few days, I will smile at how easy this actually is for me now”
- Think in a structured way. Coding is similar to writing a dissertation (only a lot more fun). Instead of writing a bunch of code right away, the easiest way to go about it is to write down a structure through comments or pseudo code, and then fill it in.
- When learning, don't try to memorize every built-in function right away: that's what practice is for

4. Some core concepts you need to learn:
- Four main programming paradigms
- Testing
- Databases
  - SQL or relational databases:
    - most used type of databases
    - stores data in rows and columns: each column receives an entity (ex: name, age, is married) and entities are related in some way
  - noSQL or non-relational databases:
    - most recent and gaining in popularity
    - stores data in 
    - benefits: fast, no fixed table schemas, scalable, simple design
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): software that allow users and databases to talk to each other
  - REST API

5. Some additional concepts you may want to learn if your looking for a back-end position
- GraphQL
- Systems design
