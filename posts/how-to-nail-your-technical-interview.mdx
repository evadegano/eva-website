Technical interviews are hands down the most stressful thing for a junior Web Developer.

They can take a few different shapes: showing a project you're proud of, doing a home assignment, answering technical questions, or solving a coding challenge.

The latter is rightly the most dreaded, but with the right strategy, not only will you feel ready to take up on that challenge, you'll also feel excited as hell to put your new algo-solving skills to the test!

And you know what, the right strategy is exactly what I'm going to give you in this post.

## 1. Get the right mindset
Training your mind is even more important than training your algo

Here's what I want you to do during this training: 
- Fight your brain’s initial instinct to freeze and panic. Tell yourself it's alright, there's no reason to panic. Then regroup and focus on dissecting the problem methodically. No need to find the whole solution right away, go step by step.
- Remember that the problem is always easier than it first seems. The wording is often made to mindf*ck you. But the content is always the same. Once you've learnt a few different patterns, you'll have a toolset to choose from.
- Try to approach it in a way that’s fun for you (ex: imagine it's a riddle).

## 2. Review common complexities

Read this cheat sheet once to make sure you remember common complexities:

Then when you practice with coding exercices, keep it by your side and 

## 3. Practice your recursive thinking
Recursions are when a function or some other subprogram calls itself.

"Wtf" is what you usually say to yourself the first time you see encouter them.

But do not panic!
With a bit of practice - about 10 hours of it - recursions will start making sense.

And you'll see how f*cking cool they are. Recursion is this thing that makes you answer problems elegantly and feel proud about your problem-solving skills.

Here are 3 videos that helped me finally understand recursions:


In a nutshell:
- Avoid thinking about recursion at all
- Start by solving the problem for the simplest input possible to understand the underlying mechanics. 
This will make things easier and give you your base cases.

## 4. Get comfortable with the most common data structures and their operations

From what I've seen, there are many different data structures out there.

But as a junior web dev, I feel like you can get away with knowing just a few of them.

If you don't know what stacks, queues, arrays and key-value objects are, start by checking them out :)

Once you have, move on to the next videos and make sure you do the exercices.

### Graphs

## 4. Study the most common search algorithms

While data structure are ways to store and organize data, algorithms process that data and perform calculations to find a solution to a problem.

## 5. Learn dynamic programming

## 6. Practice on problems
Alright, now the real fun begins!

Resolving algorithmic problems may seem super annoying at first, but after a few exercices, you'll see that this is by far the most rewarding step.

At a certain point, your brain will start to 'get it' and everything will start being obvious.

With all the coding practice sites out there, which one should you choose?

In my experience, avoid Codewars! There are way too many problems and most of them are low quality.
Instead, go for a platform that has a more curated content.

If you're willing to pay, I strongly recommend you use [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product).
As it was designed for the sole purpose of hepling you ace your technical interview, it will save you a lot of time and energy.
