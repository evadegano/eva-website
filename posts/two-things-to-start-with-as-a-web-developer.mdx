If you're just starting your journey as a Software Engineer, chances are you're feeling quite lost.
I mean, programming is part of such a rich ecosystem!

I'll be honest, learning how to code will take a while. But there are two things you can start with and that will speed up the process dramatically.

## 1. Find a mentor

Becoming something is never just about learning some skills. It's first and foremost about developing the mind of whatever you want to become.

So my very first advice to you is: find a mentor online or in real life.

Find a programmer who inspires you based on their values, their skills as programmers, their journey, or whatever else. And consume their content, see who they follow on social media, what they talk about and how they talk about it.

That may seem irrelevant or overkill, but it's nothing of the sort. All masters have had mentors to learn from osmosis from. An after all, we're the average of the people we surround ourselves with aren't we? 

When I started programming, Cl√©ment Mihailescu pretty quickly became my mentor. Not only his <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g' target='_blank'>Youtube channel</a> provided me great value, guidance and motivation, but he's also someone who's humble yet goes out of his way to exceed expectations in everything he does. Both traits that I deeply value.

## 2. Live and breath tech

You cannot become an awesome developer if you're not curious about tech.

I mean, programming really is one of those jobs where if you stop learning, you become obsolete.
So the sooner you get this habit, the better!

Everytime you're on your computer, I want you to be bombarded with tech stuff.

Some of the ressources you just have to use:
- <a src='https://news.ycombinator.com/' target='_blank'>Hacker News</a>
- <a src='https://www.producthunt.com/' target='_blank'>Product Hunt</a>
- <a src='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tech-stories-tab-by-hacke/cmcgnandlhnjekeccmongfellpljlohh' target='_blank'>Hackernoon Chrome extension</a>
- <a src='https://www.awwwards.com/' target='_blank'>Awwwards</a>
- <a src='https://www.behance.net/' target='_blank'>Behance</a>, <a src='https://dribbble.com/' target='_blank'>Dribbble</a> and <a src='https://onepagelove.com/' target='_blank'>One Page Love</a> are cool as well

Seems like a lot to remember?

- <a src='https://www.youtube.com/c/EatTheBlocks' target='_blank'>EatTheBlocks</a> for Blockchain engineering

This list is obviously not exhaustive, but it's enough to get you going and fire up Youtube's recommendation algorithm.

Finally, I tried a few podcasts but I found it very hard to hear about programming - which is quite a visual thing.

As for Twitter, I'm not on it (it tried but it just never stuck) so I can't help you on that one.
