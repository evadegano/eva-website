One of my mottos in life is "Start being before you start doing".
Whatever my goal is, I find ways to embody it, even before I start pursuing it.

This was true for programming as well. When I decided to become a Software Engineer, the first thing I did was surround myself with tech - tech articles, tech videos, tech podcasts, tech everything.

And if you're serious about programming, you're going to have to develop a tech culture anyway.

I mean, programming really is one of those jobs where if you stop learning, you become obsolete.
So the sooner you get this habit, the better!


## Find a mentor
Before you dive in the theory, search for people who are outstanding at this skill and identify what makes them outstanding. Search the internet to understand what sets masters away from the masses. Use your findings to shape the way you study. What seems to separate great from average developers?

- Find someone that inspires you, based on their values, their skills as programmers, their journey, etc.
- See this person as a mentor. Read their posts, watch their videos. Ultimately, you'll start learning from them by osmosis.
After all, we're the average of the people we surround ourselves with aren't we? So choose carefully. 

- for me, it was this guy:
- I love that he's humble, but goes out of his way to exceed expectations in everything he does. Both traits that I deeply value.


## Live and breath tech
Everytime you open your computer, when you search something on Google, when you take a break on Youtube, I want you to stumble on tech stuff.

Some of the ressources you have to use:
- Product Hunt
- Hacker News
- Hackernoon Chrome plugin
- Behance, Dribble and Awwards if you're into web design

Seems like a lot to remember? 
- UsePanda allows you to have all your sources in one place.

I tried a few podcasts but I found it very hard to hear about programming - which is quite a visual thing.
