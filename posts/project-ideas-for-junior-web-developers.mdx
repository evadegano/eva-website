Building projects is crucial, not only for your portfolio, but also to understand what you've learnt at a cellular level. Trust me. Even if you feel like this photographic memory of yours has got you covered, you're not a Developer until you've developped something.

When I was building my portfolio, what I found the hardest was not the coding part, but coming up with a project idea!

After cruising all over the internet, it seemed like the only thing people were interested in was Tic-tac-toe. I was desperate.

If you're feeling lost as well, you'll definitely find the guidance you need in this post.

## 1. The projects you should build

Your portfolio's purpose is to show recruiters that you've done the things they'll ask you to do that they won't have to look after you all the time. But it's also a great way to to show your personality, so choose projects that reflect who you are and <a src='/the-five-main-types-of-programmers' target='_blank'>what kind of developer</a> you want to be.

Here's an awesome video to start with:

And a second one that will answer all your questions:

So in a nutshell, you should build the following:
- A CRUD (Create Read Updat Delete) project, meaning a project with a front-end and a back-end, where users interact (do CRUD operations) with a database.
- An e-commerce that includes: an API, payment processing, SEO, content optimization, checkout optimization, analytics.
- An API

To find ideas, just go to Youtube and write "build clone with" followed by your programming language.

You'll find a tone of great tutorials to build famous, complex products. Then all you have to do is add your own twist to it to make something that's unique.

## 2. How you should present your portfolio

Here are a few important things to keep in mind:
- You MUST have a cool and modern looking project. Even if you don't care about front-end, that's the first thing recruiters will see. So once you have your idea, get a free <a src='https://www.figma.com/' target='_blank'>Figma</a> template or get inspiration from one of the following websites:
  - <a src='https://www.awwwards.com/' target='_blank'>Awwwards</a>
  - <a src='https://www.behance.net/' target='_blank'>Behance</a>
  - <a src='https://dribbble.com/' target='_blank'>Dribbble</a>
  - <a src='https://onepagelove.com/' target='_blank'>One Page Love</a>
- Once your project is finished, deploy it on <a src='https://www.heroku.com/' target='_blank'>Heroku</a>.
- Customize your Github profile and <a src='https://github.com/evadegano#:~:text=Customize%20your%20pins-,Pinned,-quartz%20Public' target='_blank'>pin your projects</a>
