        <p>
          After getting a Master's Degree in Finance and Investment and being a Project Manager for +4 years, working with developers made me realize that Computer Science and Programming were my true passions.
          <br/><span className={utilStyles.markedText}>I deeply value learning and sharing knowledge through content and tools that improve people's lives.</span> And tech is what makes it possible at scale.
          That's one of the many reasons why I decided to become a Software Engineer.
