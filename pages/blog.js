            <p>If you have you recently started your journey as a Software Engineer or if you are thinking about doing so, you should find this blog helpful.</p>
            <p>While the abundance of resources available over the internet is amazing, it can quickly feel overwhelming. I am sure you have experienced this yourself.</p>
            <p>Thatâ€™s why I started this blog: to share with you the strategy and ressources that allowed me to graduate at the top of my Software Engineer program's cohort and feel good about my skills as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
            <p>More than that, I hope to take you beyond Programming and show you how exciting Computer Science can be.</p>
